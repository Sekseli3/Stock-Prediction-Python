# Stock-Prediction-Python

Project made using pythons wonderful libraries including, sklearn, numpy, pandas, tensorflow, matplot and mplfinance.  This Machine Learning project will attempt to understand how a stock price would develop in the future.

## ML methods

 ML method used is a neural network LSTM (long short-term memory network) and loss function used is mean squared error, MSE. Available data (5 years of stock price) was split 90% training and 10% testing. Trained with 32 batch size and 100 epochs.
